===== Prepare the certificate and certificate key

Open the certificate into an editor of your choice and copy the certificate and paste it directly in the textbox in next step. This will result in the entire certificate being on a single line and it will automatically convert all CRLF or LF characters to spaces.
Follow the same process for the certificate key.


===== Add the license keys and certificate to AWS Secrets Manager

. Open AWS Secrets Manager in the same Region in which you deploy the Quick Start.
. Choose Store a new secret.
. Choose Other type of secret.
. For the secret key value, create six rows for the Artifactory licenses.
. Key names should be as follows, with the key values being Artifactory license keys (see <<secret_manager_licenses>>)):
.. `ArtifactoryLicense1`
.. `ArtifactoryLicense2`
.. `ArtifactoryLicense3`
.. `ArtifactoryLicense4`
.. `ArtifactoryLicense5`
.. `ArtifactoryLicense6`

. Choose *Next*.
. Provide a secret name. This name is used to deploy this Quick Start.
. Choose *Next* twice.
. Choose *Store*.

Repeat the above steps for storing the certificate details in AWS Secrets Manager.

* You will need to create three rows for the certificate information retrieved in the preparation of the certificate in the <<Prepare the certificate and certificate key>> section:
.. `Certificate`
.. `CertificateKey`
.. `CertificateDomain`

===== Subscribe to the CentOS AMI

This Quick Start requires a subscription to the AMI for CentOS in AWS Marketplace.

. Sign in to your AWS account.
. {marketplace_listing_url}[Open the page for the CentOS AMI in AWS Marketplace], and then choose *Continue to Subscribe*.
. Review the terms and conditions for software usage, and then choose *Accept Terms*. +
  A confirmation page loads, and an email confirmation is sent to the account owner. For detailed subscription instructions, see the https://aws.amazon.com/marketplace/help/200799470[AWS Marketplace documentation^].

. When the subscription process is complete, exit out of AWS Marketplace without further action. *Do not* provision the software from AWS Marketplaceâ€”the Quick Start deploys the AMI for you.
